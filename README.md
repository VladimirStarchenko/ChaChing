# ChaChing 

Picture yourself in a store hoping to make a purchase. But you remembered that the car needed some servicing last week and you already spent a lot of money. Or maybe a friends birthday is coming up but rent is due. What does one do in such a challenging series of situations? Frankly scrambling to keep your finances in order by keeping reciepts in your wallet and struggling to remember every last purchase shouldn't be a challenge in todays world. 

Thanks to ChaChing a modern MongoDb application that can function offline you can prioritize spending. Keep track of money in your account. How much of it goes to bills or personal purchases. Why sacrifice necessities or even a few luxuries when you can see the dollar figure infront of you. 

No longer will you say to yourself, I can't afford this. With ChaChing affordability will no longer be an issue, It's when you can afford it, not if.
